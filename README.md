👋 Hi, I’m Abdullahi Isah

🔐 Fullstack JavaScript Developer & Cybersecurity Scientist
Passionate about designing and building secure cryptographic systems that are resistant to statistical and brute-force attacks.

I combine software development skills with cryptographic research in algebra, number theory, and diffusion algorithms — aiming to create the next generation of future-proof encryption schemes.

🚀 Current Project: Palestine Cipher

The Palestine Cipher is my flagship research and implementation project — an enhanced symmetric cipher inspired by Vigenère but built to overcome its weaknesses.

🔑 Key Features:

Palestine Key – Non-periodic key generation with near-random distribution (IC ≈ 1/26).

NEWS Functions – Four reversible diffusion algorithms (North, East, West, South) based on skew-symmetric structures.

Alpha, Beta, Gamma Enhancements – Layers of key expansion + plaintext diffusion.

Optimized Gamma – Efficient implementation avoiding heavy matrix operations while maximizing security.

Resistant to frequency analysis, with strong avalanche effect and asymmetric work factor for attackers.
